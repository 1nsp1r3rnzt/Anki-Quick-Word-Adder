Anki is a freemium software based on the concept of spaced repitition. It accelerates the process of learning by helping to retain information in long-term memory.

The concept of utilizing Anki gets complicated when you encounter a difficult word while browsing on your computer. The flow is interruptedÂ as you have to stop reading an article and add the word to Anki.

This software eases the process by retreiving meaning from dictionary.com API
Also, needs user to copy meaning for assuring that atleast a meaning is retreived for every word.
The benefit of using this software is that you get the ability to copy the sentence in which you have found the word. This approach is better than relying on sentences found in dictionary which may not be used in contemporary times.
